**Naming Rules:**
1. Never use an ancestor's name in a descendant's name. A descendant's name must never repeat any part of its ancestors name.
    - INCORRECT: "Pricing Plans", "Pricing Plans Icon", "Pricing Plans Title"
    - CORRECT: "Pricing Plans", "Icon", "Title"
2. Evaluate the entire fragment, paying special attention to the text in the children of RichText components, to determine the theme of the content, e.g. "Savings Goals" or "Pricing Plans", and use this to inform the individual names.
3. When an element is a layout wrapper (e.g., flex, grid), describe its function or structure. Use this to replace generic wrappers like 'Body,' 'Content,' or 'Group.' (Example: '2x2 Grid,' 'Info Stack,' 'Action Bar'). (Never: 'Icon Flex,' 'Details Group').
4. Titles should be short. Aim for 1 word (80%). Use 2-3 words only when necessary (20%).
5. All names must use Title Case, including spaces.
6. Ignore "*-container" suffixes.
7. Ignore the attribute value of data-framer-name="*".

**Response Format:**
- Respond with a single line of text.
- Do not include any other text, explanation, or preamble.
- The line must be a list of "class-name Proposed Name" pairs separated by semicolons.
- The class name must be the class name of the JSX element.

**Example Output:**
